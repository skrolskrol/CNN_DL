Tea leaf disease detection using Convolutional Neural Networks

The Tea Leaf Disease Detection project aims to develop a computer vision solution for automated detection and classification of diseases in tea leaves. By leveraging Tensorflow and FastAPI, this project provides a comprehensive pipeline for preprocessing tea leaf images, training a CNN model, and deploying a user-friendly API backend for disease prediction. With this project, tea plantation farmers and researchers can easily identify and monitor diseases affecting tea leaves, enabling timely interventions and improved crop management practices.

Features:

Preprocessing- I have used Tensorflow, Keras and Matplotlib for data loading, resizing, normalization and augmentation. This techniques help to improve the accuracy and robustness of the model.

Model building- I built a model based on Convolutional Neural Networks. The activation function used was relu. The optimiser used is Adams and loss function is Sparse Categorical Crossentropy. 

FastAPI Backend- The project integrates FastAPI, a modern Python web framework, to create a RESTful API for disease prediction. The API allows users to submit tea leaf images and receive real-time predictions for disease presence and classification. It offers a user-friendly interface to interact with the trained CNN model.

By following these steps, tea leaf disease detection becomes accessible through a simple and efficient API interface, enabling users to make informed decisions about tea leaf health and take appropriate actions to prevent further spread of diseases.
